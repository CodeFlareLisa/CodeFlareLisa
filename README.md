I recently had the opportunity to go back to school, and I did not hesitate. Returning to school to earn my bachelor's degree in technology was a dream of mine. After taking my first computer coding class and creating my first project, Food Trucks' current location, along with their next location was exciting. I knew without a doubt that the only thing I wanted to do was code. My passion for technology allowed me to earn my bachelorâ€™s degree yet the coding classes took me one step further.  Now that I am with Revature, I feel extremely grateful for this next opportunity.
